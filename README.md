# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohammed-Amine (Mo)

AI Red Teamer • Cybersecurity Engineer • CTF Player

I’m a cybersecurity engineering student focused on offensive security and AI red-teaming.  
I enjoy breaking systems responsibly to help make them safer — from classic web/AD pentesting to adversarial testing of LLMs and agentic systems.

---

## 🔐 What I Work On
- AI Red Teaming: jailbreaks, prompt injection, tool misuse, agent failure modes  
- Offensive Security: web, AD, network pentesting  
- CTFs & Vulnerability Research  
- Writing clear, reproducible security reports with mitigations

---


## 📂 What You’ll Find Here
- Small red-teaming tools & scripts  
- CTF writeups (sanitized)  
- Proof-of-concepts for prompt injection / LLM failure modes  
- Notes and experiments on agentic workflows

> ⚠️ All work is for educational and defensive purposes only. No illegal activity.
